# compound
A very diverse bukkit library and essential plugin

# details
Despite the many features in compound, it isn't a very bloated plugin. With pretty much full access to the modules you want and don't want, you can completely customize your experience.

# what even is it?
Compound is meant to be a rival to the incredibly popular EssentialsX and ServerTools. Of course there is not much reason to choose my plugin in its current state, but we have a few things in the making.
We are trying to gear it to be an actually development library that you can use in your plugins, and also a real plugin. Something that is pretty rare but other plugins like qLib and Cubed have.

# what can I expect?
From what we have tested, lag is incredibly minimal and all the features have been tested to a degree. Bugs will be common in this stage, but nothing game breaking will happen.
All you need is a redis database for messages and redis packets but that is it, if you do not have access to these things then just disable them. I am working on a system for no database requirements but that will come much later.

Thanks for using my plugin or just looking at the code
